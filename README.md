# JavaScript Block Scoping with 'let' - Unexpected Variable Shadowing

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to block scoping and the `let` keyword.  Understanding how block scope works is crucial for writing correct and predictable JavaScript code.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that illustrates unexpected behavior due to block scoping with `let`. The inner `let x` declaration shadows the outer `let x`, leading to different values being logged to the console.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version where the understanding of block scope is improved. This demonstrates a best practice for declaring variables to avoid this kind of issue.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred code editor.
3. Run each file using a JavaScript runtime (Node.js, browser console, etc.). Observe the differing output between the two files.

This simple example highlights the importance of carefully considering variable scope when writing JavaScript code.  Understanding block scope is crucial for preventing subtle and hard-to-debug errors.
